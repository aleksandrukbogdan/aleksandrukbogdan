🚀 Tech Stack📊 Machine Learning & Data ScienceI specialize in building reliable and high-performance ML pipelines using modern open-source tools:
Data processing & analysis: pandas, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
Classical ML models: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch — from prototyping to model deployment
Model tracking & optimization: MLflow for experiment tracking, Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
💡 I apply machine learning not just for experimentation, but for real-world industrial and business tasks, especially in the oil & gas sector.
🧠 MLOps & Model DeploymentI actively bridge the gap between Data Science and Production:
Model serving: via RESTful APIs using FastAPI, Flask
Deployment: with Docker containers for reproducibility and scalability
Monitoring: use of tools like Prometheus and Grafana for observability and performance tracking
MLflow: used for managing lifecycle of models — from training to deployment
⚙️ My focus is on creating end-to-end pipelines that are stable, observable, and ready for integration into real production environments.
🌐 Fullstack DevelopmentI build web applications from scratch, covering both backend and frontend:
Frontend: React, with tools like Redux, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and modern UI practices
Backend: FastAPI and Flask for high-performance APIs, Django for full-stack web apps
Databases: Strong working knowledge of PostgreSQL and SQLite, including query optimization and schema design
🛠 I combine elegant frontends with robust backends to deliver user-friendly, high-performance applications.
📱 Mobile DevelopmentLanguage: Java
UX: Proficient in Material Design principles to build consistent, modern Android applications
📱 Although web and ML are my main areas, I also have a solid foundation in Android development, especially for internal tools and MVPs.
☁️ Cloud, Auth & DevOpsCloud Platforms: experience with Yandex Cloud, use of Google Auth for secure authentication
DevOps Tools: Docker for consistent deployments, bash scripting and CI familiarity
🌐 I'm comfortable managing small-scale infrastructure and deployments for ML and web projects.
